👕 Wardrobe

A Personal Smart Clothing Manager

My Wardrobe is a personal wardrobe management application built using Flutter.
It helps track clothes, manage their condition (clean / dirty), organize storage, and suggest outfits intelligently — especially useful for people who struggle with dressing sense.

This is a real-life utility app, not a sample or tutorial project.

🎯 Problem This App Solves

Forgetting which clothes are clean or dirty

Repeating the same outfits unknowingly

Owning clothes with complex colors & patterns that apps don’t understand

No clear idea of what matches with what

Clothes lying unused for long periods

My Wardrobe solves this by mirroring how people actually handle clothes in daily life.
